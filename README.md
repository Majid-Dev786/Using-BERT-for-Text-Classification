# Using BERT for Text Classification

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates how to use the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model for text classification purposes. 
The script utilizes TensorFlow and the transformers library to tokenize input text and classify it using a pre-trained BERT model.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running this script, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or later
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Transformers library

You can install the required packages using pip:

```
pip install tensorflow transformers
```

### Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine to get started:

```
git clone https://github.com/Majid-Dev786/Using-BERT-for-Text-Classification.git
```

Navigate to the cloned directory:

```
cd Using-BERT-for-Text-Classification
```

### Usage

The script can be executed with Python directly. Ensure you are in the project directory and run:

```
python Using\ BERT\ for\ Text\ Classification.py
```

The script performs the following steps:
- Initializes a BERT tokenizer and model from the `bert-base-uncased` pre-trained model.
- Defines an example sentence to classify.
- Tokenizes the input text and prepares it for classification.
- Uses the BERT model to classify the input text.
- Prints the predicted class of the input text.

## How It Works

The script utilizes the `BertTokenizer` to tokenize input text according to the BERT model's specifications (e.g., adding special tokens, padding, etc.). 
The `TFBertForSequenceClassification` model is then used to classify the input text into predefined categories. 
The output is a predicted class for the input sentence, demonstrating a simple use case of BERT for text classification.
